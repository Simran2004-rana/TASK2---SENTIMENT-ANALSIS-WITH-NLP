DESCRIPTION : In Task 2 of the CodTech Machine Learning Internship, we implemented a Logistic Regression model using the scikit-learn library. This task aimed to explore one of the most foundational and widely used algorithms in binary classification problems—Logistic Regression. It is particularly useful when the target variable is categorical in nature, usually binary (i.e., 0 or 1).We began by importing essential Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations, and modules from scikit-learn for model building and evaluation. The dataset used for this task was a breast cancer classification dataset, which is readily available through sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer(). This dataset is commonly used for binary classification tasks and includes features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. The goal is to classify tumors as either malignant or benign.After loading the dataset, we performed exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and distribution of the data. The dataset contains 30 numerical features such as mean radius, mean texture, mean area, etc., which describe characteristics of the cell nuclei. The target variable (y) represents the diagnosis—malignant (0) or benign (1).We then proceeded to split the data into training and testing sets using an 80:20 ratio through the train_test_split() function. This ensures that the model is trained on one portion of the data and evaluated on another to test its generalization ability. We used the LogisticRegression() class from sklearn.linear_model to build the model. For reproducibility and efficiency, a fixed random_state was used, and the max_iter parameter was increased to ensure convergence of the algorithm.Once the model was trained on the training dataset, we evaluated its performance on the test dataset. The evaluation metrics used included accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report (which provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class). These metrics helped us analyze the model's performance in correctly identifying malignant and benign tumors.The accuracy achieved was fairly high, indicating that Logistic Regression performed well on this binary classification problem. However, we also noted the importance of considering precision and recall separately—especially in medical diagnosis tasks—where false negatives can be far more serious than false positives.To further interpret the model, we visualized the confusion matrix using matplotlib and seaborn. The confusion matrix visually highlights how many predictions were correct and where the model made mistakes, making it easier to understand model performance at a glance.In summary, this task helped us understand the theory and implementation of Logistic Regression in a practical context. We learned how to:Load and explore real-world datasets,Train a Logistic Regression classifier,Evaluate it using performance metrics,And visualize results to draw meaningful conclusions.This task also emphasized the real-world application of machine learning in healthcare, and how predictive models can support critical decision-making. Logistic Regression remains a strong baseline algorithm for binary classification, and this project provided essential hands-on experience with it.
